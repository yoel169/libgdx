# libgdx
Libgdx is a very handy cross platform java framework to make 2D and 3D games. 
This is my libgdx project journey following this very good series: https://www.gamedevelopment.blog/full-libgdx-game-tutorial-flgt-home/

To setup follow this tutorial but you don't need to download gdx-setup.jar: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Running%20and%20Debugging.html
